## Recent Issues

### Agent Timeout Errors (October 17, 2025) - RESOLVED âœ…
**Symptom**: Agents experiencing TimeoutError (code 23) and slow response times

**Root Cause**: Local Ollama (llama3.1:8b) was too slow for real-time chat interactions

**Solution Implemented**: Switched to OpenRouter API with GPT-4o-mini
- Added OpenRouter integration to `src/agent.ts`
- Modified all LLM-dependent methods: `shouldRespond()`, `decideAction()`, `generateResponse()`
- Created `callOpenRouter()` helper method for API calls
- Environment configuration in `.env`:
  - `USE_OPENROUTER=true`
  - `MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini`
  - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...`

**Results**:
- Response times improved from 30+ seconds to 4-9 seconds
- All three test queries responded successfully:
  1. "What's your favorite color?" - 5 seconds
  2. "Tell me about your capabilities?" - 4 seconds  
  3. "What do you think about the weather?" - 9 seconds
- Agent decision-making and response generation working correctly
- Honcho integration verified and working
- Chat history properly logged

**Code Structure**:
- OpenRouter calls use chat completions API format
- JSON mode enabled for structured decision-making responses
- Fallback to Ollama preserved when `USE_OPENROUTER=false`
- All methods check `USE_OPENROUTER` flag before choosing provider

## Web Interface Project

- Structured messaging system

### Approach
Creating a **Live Demo Dashboard** with:
- Real-time chat interface
- Agent decision visualization
- Connection method showcase
- Interactive demo capabilities

### Technical Stack for Web Interface
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla or lightweight framework)
- Socket.IO client for real-time connection
- Modern, responsive design
- Terminal-inspired aesthetic to match LanChat's nature
